# Pygame_Walkthrough_Project_Space_Invaders

Hello!

This is my very first major walkthrough project regarding the pygame library for python. I created a space invader game from scratch with the help of a walkthrough youtube guide.

Here is the video that helped me complete this walkthrough project. Big shoutout to FreeCodeCamp for making this video!

## Breif overview of Pygame from it's website:
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.

## Conculsion and Purpose
I am hoping to create my own video game from scratch using the pygame library using my own knowledge and experiences.. with the exception of internet ressources to use for references
